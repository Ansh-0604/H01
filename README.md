With the rise of sophisticated cybersecurity threats, traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that rely on rule-based or signature-based techniques often fail to detect emerging attacks, including zero-day vulnerabilities. This project presents a real-time IDS leveraging Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Kafka, and deep learning to analyze network traffic efficiently and identify potential intrusions.

The system utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to detect malicious activities by processing network traffic patterns. LSTMs are well-suited for this task as they can capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, improving anomaly detection accuracy. The architecture is designed to handle large-scale data streams efficiently, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance through big data processing frameworks.

Key components include:

Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, for collecting and managing high-throughput network traffic data.

Apache Spark Streaming, which processes real-time data in micro-batches, enhancing speed and scalability.

LSTM-based deep learning models to classify network traffic as normal or suspicious, enabling accurate anomaly detection.

The system ensures real-time alerting to administrators upon detecting potential intrusions, allowing timely intervention. The integration of big data processing with AI-driven cybersecurity mechanisms results in a highly efficient, low-latency IDS, offering a robust solution for modern network security challenges.
